// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
//      and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
//      as well (draw means they have the same average score)
// 3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
//    team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
//    score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
//    score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ï¿½
// 4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
//    both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
//     points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
